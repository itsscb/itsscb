# Hello there
Love to expand my horizon - especially with code. Learning is living and coding is life.

## 💻 Full-Stack Developer | 🦀 Rust Enthusiast | 🐧 Linux Aficionado

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about writing code and building efficient, robust applications.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Rust, Go
- **Frontend:** Yew, Angular, Tailwind CSS
- **Automation:** PowerShell (expert), Bash, Ansible
- **OS:** NixOS (current), Comfortable with Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Windows

### 🚀 What I'm Up To

- Exploring the Rust ecosystem and building web applications with Yew
- Crafting efficient and maintainable backend services
- Automating everything I can with PowerShell and Bash
- Tinkering with NixOS and diving deep into the Linux world

### 🌱 Current Focus

I'm currently transitioning from Go and Angular to Rust and WASM + Tailwind for most of my projects. I'm excited about the performance and safety benefits that Rust brings to both backend and frontend development.

### 💡 Fun Fact

While I'm comfortable in Windows, I've found my true home in Linux. NixOS has become my daily driver, and I'm loving the declarative approach to system configuration!
