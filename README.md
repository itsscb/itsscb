> **Important**: Given the current uncertainty in the U.S. and Microsoft’s black-box policies around GitHub code handling, I’ve deployed my own  [Gitea instance](https://git.itsscb.de/itsscb) and moved all my repos there.

Hello there! I’m a passionate software developer with a focus on building efficient, scalable systems using modern technologies. I enjoy working across the stack—from performant backend services to interactive frontend experiences.

🛠️ Tech Stack Highlights:

Backend: Rust, Go

Frontend: Angular, Yew (Rust-based)

Automation & Scripting: PowerShell, Bash, Rust

I’m always up for a good coding challenge and love exploring new tools and paradigms. Feel free to check out my repositories—whether you're interested in collaborating on a project, discussing ideas, or just geeking out about code, I’d love to connect!
